# PWA Icons

This app requires PWA icons for installation. You need to create the following icon files:

- `/public/icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `/public/icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Generation

You can use online tools like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

Or create them manually with your design tool of choice. The icons should:
- Use the dark midnight blue (#0a1929) background
- Include gold/yellow accents (#fbbf24)
- Be recognizable at small sizes
- Follow PWA icon best practices (maskable icons)

Once created, place them in the `/public` directory and the app will use them automatically.
